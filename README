Forces to resolve a local domain instead of searching for results in google.

How many times you've found that you type in your new tab something like... "subdomain.mylocaldomain.atwork" press enter... and you go straight to the google search results!

With this small extension you can fix this behaviour and it will try to resolve that domain you just typed.

ChangeLog
v1.3 - Urls with directory path are now supported
v1.2 - Domains with "-" in the domain name weren't resolving properly
v1.1 - Sometimes the dns resolution was not working
v1.0 - Initial release
